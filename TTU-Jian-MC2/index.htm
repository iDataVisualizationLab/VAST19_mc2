        <h4>System Overview</h4>
        Our visualization application includes four parts: The heat map, the St. Himark map, the control panel and the time series chart.The heat map shows the readings of all the sensors that have appeared in a region for the entire five-day time span (April 4 to April 10). The x axis of the heatmap represents time and y axis
        represents different sensor readings, including mobile sensors and static sensors in a certain region. A square represents the maximum reading of a certain sensor in 30 minutes
        period. The opacity  of the border from 0 to 1 shows the number of readings from 0 to 360 in that period.
        The map shows all 19 regions in St. Highmark. Each region can be clicked to show/hide the corresponding heat map. Multiple regions can be selected to compare.
        The control panel shows the color scale of the heat map, and selection options for easily controlling both the heat map and the time series chart. The map and the control panel can be dragged conveniently.
        Finally, the time series shows the reading of all 50 mobile sensors and 9 static sensors spanning over the entire 5 days. The x axis represents timestamps of 30 minutes
        interval in 5 days. The y axis represents the average values for the readings. The legend of the time series can be highlighted
        and clicked. Toggling the legend box will show/hide the corresponding line. Toggle-clicking a line will show the area between the line's maximun and minimum values. This
        could give us a big picture of the value range.

        <h4>Questions</h4>

        <div class="question">1- Visualize radiation measurements over time from both static and mobile sensors to identify areas where radiation over background is detected. Characterize changes over time.</div>

        <img id="all" src="images/f_1_1.png" class="full">
         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 2. Overview of all sensors for the entire time span.</span></p>

         <div> The time series chart in Figure 2 shows an overview of the average values of  all sensors for the entire time span (5 days). Sensors are listed top-down. The last 9 sensors are
             static sensors. As is shown, mobile sensor 9, 10,  21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29 and 45 tends to have very high average readings. These readings may result from high
             radiation level around the sensor.


         </div>

        <img id="mobiles" src="images/f_1_2.jpg" class="full">
         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 3. Overview of static sensor readings.</span></p>
         <div>
             Figure 3 shows readings from all 9 static sensors over the entire time span. A pattern can be detected that all static sensors except static-13 tend to have
             clustered high readings around 3pm on April 9th until the end of April 10th. Which indicates that they constantly detected radiation during that period. On the
             contraty, static sensor 15 almost has no readings at all during this period. We will look into this in the next question.

         <!--<div> Figure 5 is an example when Old Town is selected. The arrow points to 4pm on Wed 08 with the high readings of the dynamic sensor 10. <br><br></div>-->
    

        <div class="question">2 - Use visual analytics to represent and analyze uncertainty in the measurement of radiation across the city. <br>
a. Compare uncertainty of the static sensors to the mobile sensors. What anomalies can you see? Are there sensors that are too uncertain to trust?<br>
b. Which regions of the city have greater uncertainty of radiation measurement? Use visual analytics to explain your rationale.<br>
c. What effects do you see in the sensor readings after the earthquake and other major events? What effect do these events have on uncertainty?<br>
        </div>

        <img id="stat-13" src="images/f_2_1.png" class="full">
         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 4. Comparison between static-13 and static-15.</span></p>
        <div>
            As described above, there is contrary readings between static-13 and static-15. We can see in figure 4 that static-13 is the sensor that
            is closest to the nuclear plant among all the 9 static sensors. If there is a radiation leak, this sensor should be the first to detect it.
            However, compared to static-15,the second closest static sensor to the nuclear plant, its reading is abnormal. The readings of static-13
            during the period when radiation level is mostly detected by other sensors are missing. Therefore, static-13 is too uncertain to trust.


        </div>

         <img id="stat-11" src="images/f_2_3.png" class="full">
         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 5. Comparison between static-11 and other mobile sensors in region 9.</span></p>
         <div>
             Figure 5 shows a discrepancy between static-11 and other mobile sensors in region 9 Broadview. Static-11 shows frequent high reading values
             from April 9th to the end of April 10th, while there are not enough mobile sensors agree with it.  The only available readings during
             this period from the mobile sensors is mobile-26, however, the readings are all the same value. Given the commonsense that the sensor detector
             may be affected by many factors, including the condition of the car, the road and the weather, etc., the readings could not stay the same for hours.
             Therefore, without additional static or mobile sensor readings, it is hard to tell if static-11's reading is reliable or not. Thus, region 9
             has greater uncertainty ot radiation measurement.

         <div>
             Figure 6, figure 7 shows an overview of most sensor readings by region. We can detect two major intensively high reading periods,
             one is around 9 am on April 8, the other is around 3:00 pm on April 9. And we assume that these are the times when the two earth quake happened.
             The second high reading period lasted longer than the first one, indicating that the second earthquake was more intense.

        <div class="question">3 - Given the uncertainty you observed in question 2, are the radiation measurements reliable enough to locate areas of concern?<br>
a. Highlight potential locations of contamination, including the locations of contaminated cars. Should St. Himark officials be worried about contaminated cars moving around the city?<br>
b. Estimate how many cars may have been contaminated when coolant leaked from the Always Safe plant. Use visual analysis of radiation measurements to determine if any have left the area.<br>
c. Indicated where you would deploy more sensors to improve radiation monitoring in the city. Would you recommend more static sensors or more mobile sensors or both? Use your visualization of radiation measurement uncertainty to justify your recommendation.<br> </div>

         <p class="caption"><span>Figure 9.Mobile sensors in region 7.</span></p>



         <div>
             Figure 8 and 9 shows that mobile sensor 21, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29 and 45 in region 7 has extremely high values
             from 7:00pm April 9th to 8:am April 10th. In addition, they all have similar routes and destinations which is region 7. Because
             they are pretty far away from the nuclear plant, it is not likely that this region is contaminated directly by the leak. An
             assumption is that one or some of these sensors got contaminated by the coolant and passed it to this region, then contaminated other
             sensors. <br><br>
             Another observation is that mobile-24, 25, 27, 28 and 45 have all been to region 9. As we pointed out above, region 9 has
             greater uncertainty for lack of enough sensor readings. Therefore, adding more static sensors to this region might improve
             the radiation monitoring in the city.

        <div> Figure 8 shows the details of 8 sensors with high readings on Fri 10. Here are some observations: <br>
                    - They all have similar routes at the end: passing through Scenic Vista and then Wilson Forest. <br>
                    - Sensor 45 visited Safe Town, close to the Always Safe plant, and may carry some radiation from there. Sensor 45 might be attached to the contaminated car. We investigate this in the next figure.<br><br>

            "When an earthquake strikes St. Himark, the nuclear power plant suffers damage resulting in a leak of radioactive contamination. Further, a coolant leak sprayed employees’ cars and contaminated them at varying levels". We think that the car carrying sensor 45 potentially carried the radioactive contamination to Wilson Forest which contaminates other cars.

        <div> On a separated investigation, Figure 10 shows the details of 2 sensors 13 and 32. They both came in and contaminated, and then leaving on the same day. The radiation contamination is reduced as they left the Always Safe plant. <br><br>

        So, there are 3 cars which may have been contaminated when coolant leaked from the Always Safe plant: sensors 13, 32, and 45.

          <div>           
             We decided to look into the hour when the readings started raising, shown in the next Figure (Figure 11).   <br><br>

        <div> Figure 11 shows the readings of sensor 45, 21, 29, and 25 at 7 pm, Thu 09. We can see the sudden increase of readings as they entered Wilson Forest. The contaminated location is marked on the map at the red circle.<br>
         </div>  

          <img id="radarChart" src="images/f_3_31.png" class="full">

     <div class="pageContent"> 

         <div> Figure 12 shows the cars exiting the contaminated area and their reading was reduced significantly. However, a), b), and c) represent very different exit patterns: <br> 
            a) sudden decrease on the move. This indecates that the cars are moving out of the contaminated area<br>
            b) decrease while standing in the same location for the entire hour. This indecates that the radioactive contamination has been collected and carried out of the current location, and <br>c) reduce by levels (ladder pattern). This might indecates that the radioactive contamination has been partially collected. <br> <br>
         </div>  

           <div>           
             The city should deploy more static sensors along Scenic Vista to Wilson Forest since this is the contaminated route of many cars (shown in Figure 8).<br>
             - This area is far from the city center and received less attention.<br>
             - This area is frequently affected by the earthquake. <br><br>    
          </div>

        <div>  Figure 13 highlights sensor readings which suggested that the radioactive contamination was inflated by the earthquake at 3pm on Wed 08. The car was stucked in Scenic Vista (as we investigate the later hours). <br><br></div>



        <div class="question">4 - Summarize the state of radiation measurements at the end of the available period. Use your novel visualizations and analysis approaches to suggest a course of action for the city. Use visual analytics to compare the static sensor network to the mobile sensor network. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? How do they support each other? <br> </div>

         <div>  For the cars exiting Wilson Forest, we observe an increasing trend of radiation readings toward the end of the available period. Figure 15 shows the last hour of the readings of sensors: 21, 25, 27, and 28. This suggests that these cars/trucks collected the radioactive contamination from Wilson Forest and dump those in a remote area outside of the St. Himark limits.<br><br></div>



         <div>  The city should deploy the following course of actions: <br>
            - Automatically detect high sensor reading fluctuation. For example, if the sudden increase of readings is consistent, there should be a mechanism to notify the city officers for further investigation and timely actions. <br>
            - Combine dynamic and static sensor readings. If the cars drive a nearby a static sensor, we should perform cross-validation to possibly (1) remove or auto-correct the malfunction sensors (could be dynamic or static) (2) use the static sensor to verify if dynamic sensor and the car is contaminated (3) The crosstalks can be also applied for dynamic to dynamic sensors: the two cars visit the same locations at small time interval (does not need to be at the same time). <br><br>
         </div>

         <div class="question">5 - The data for this challenge can be analyzed either as a static collection or as a dynamic stream of data, as it would occur in a real emergency. Describe how you analyzed the data - as a static collection or a stream. How do you think this choice affected your analysis?  <br><br>  </div>
            Switching to real-time data does not affect our visual analytics solution since the charts for every hour are built independently. For the current hour, the data can be accumulated in real-time and the five-number summary (minimum, Q1, mean, Q3, and maximum) can be updated and re-plotted on-the-fly without effecting historical data and drawings. <br>

            Therefore, we think that this choice would not affect our analysis. <br>
